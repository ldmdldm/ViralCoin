# ViralCoin: AI-Powered Trend Token Factory

## Overview
ViralCoin is an intelligent platform that monitors cultural, news and social media trends across multiple platforms, then autonomously creates, launches and markets tokenized derivatives of those trends with strategic tokenomics and lifecycle management.

ViralCoin can generate various types of tokens based on current trends and memecoins are just one option among many. Our platform uses advanced AI algorithms to analyze trends and create optimized token configurations for maximum market impact.

## Key Components

### 1. Multi-Source Trend Analysis Engine
- Smart contracts ingest trend data from oracles that monitor Twitter, Reddit, news APIs, and Google Trends
- AI classifies trends by sustainability, emotional resonance, and memetic potential
- Categorization system ranks trends by "tokenization potential" using a proprietary scoring algorithm
- Supports various trend categories including crypto, meme, tech, finance, and entertainment

### 2. Dynamic Tokenomics Generator
- AI analyzes successful token designs and creates custom tokenomics for each trend
- Parameters include supply curves, tax structures, liquidity allocations
- Token mechanics are tailored to the specific trend category
- Each generated token has optimized parameters for its trend category

### 3. Auto-Marketing Smart Contract Suite
- Contracts automatically allocate marketing funds based on trend momentum
- Integrates with social platforms through oracles to measure engagement
- Uses game theory to optimize timing of liquidity events and marketing pushes

### 4. Sentiment-Responsive Liquidity Management
- Monitors sentiment around the token and adjusts liquidity accordingly
- Implements buyback and burn mechanisms when sentiment dips below thresholds
- Maximizes token longevity and stability

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- Vyper 0.3.7+
- Web3.py

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/viralcoin.git
cd viralcoin

# Set up virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:

```
TWITTER_API_KEY=your_twitter_api_key
REDDIT_API_KEY=your_reddit_api_key
NEWS_API_KEY=your_news_api_key
ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=your_ethereum_rpc_url
PRIVATE_KEY=your_ethereum_private_key
```

## Usage

### Analyzing Trends
```python
from ai.trend_analyzer import TrendAnalyzer

# Initialize with API keys
analyzer = TrendAnalyzer({
    'twitter': 'your_twitter_api_key',
    'reddit': 'your_reddit_api_key',
    'news': 'your_news_api_key'
})

# Get current trends
trends = analyzer.analyze_trends()
print(f"Top trends: {trends['top_trends']}")

# Generate token configuration for a specific trend
config = analyzer.suggest_token_configuration('defi')
print(f"Token configuration: {config}")
```

### Deploying a Token
```bash
# Deploy a token based on the current top trend
python scripts/deploy_trending_token.py

# Deploy a token based on a specific trend
python scripts/deploy_token.py --trend "nft"
```
